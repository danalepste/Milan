            <h1 style="text-align:center">Fashion, design, and fine cuisine reign supreme in this oft-overlooked Italian city</h1>
            <p>Milan is financially the most important city in Italy, and home to the Borsa Italiana stock exchange. It is the second most populous city proper in the country, but sits at the centre of Italy's largest urban and metropolitan area. While not considered as beautiful as some Italian cities, having been greatly destroyed by Second World War bomb raids, the city has rebuilt itself into a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. In essence, for a tourist, what makes Milan interesting compared to other places is that the city is truly more about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures: a paradise for shopping, football, opera, and nightlife. Milan remains the marketplace for Italian fashion – fashion aficionados, supermodels and international paparazzi descend upon the city twice a year for its spring and autumn fairs.</p>
            <p>Milan is famous for its wealth of historical and modern sights - the Duomo, one of the biggest and grandest Gothic cathedrals in the world, La Scala, one of the best established opera houses in the world, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, a glamorous 19th-century arcaded shopping gallery, the Brera art gallery, with some of the finest artistic works in Europe, the Pirelli tower, a majestic example of 1960s modernist Italian architecture, the San Siro, a huge and famed stadium, or the Castello Sforzesco, a grand medieval castle. So, you have your fair share of old and new monuments. Plus, it contains one of the world's most famous paintings - Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.</p> 
            <h1 style="text-align:center" id="museums">Museums in Milan</h1>

            <img src="https://fv9-3.failiem.lv/thumb_show.php?i=pvmd3tdsf&view" alt="Restaurants" width="1500" height="250">
            <p>In a country that has one of the finest cuisines worldwide, you can always expect to eat well, no matter your location. However, Milan offers some exceptional restaurants that are culinary destinations in their own right.
          Each of these restaurants offers something unique, whether it be their individual play on Italian cuisine or their sumptuous surroundings; with our guide, deciding on where to eat in Milan has never been easier. Look no further to find some of the best restaurants in Milan.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="https://aimoenadia.com/en/"><strong>Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia.</strong></a> This family restaurant, founded by Aimo and Nadia Moroni in 1962, has arguably become one of the top restaurants in Milan, having been awarded two Michelin stars. The restaurant is now run by Aimo and Nadia’s daughter, Stefania Moroni, alongside Alessandro Negrini and Fabio Pisani. The tasting menu is the best way to sample the kitchen team’s knowledge and love of Tuscan cuisine. It includes subtle Italian flavored dishes such as Roasted lamb ‘torcinello’ with pecorino cheese from Calabria and Cappellini green beans. At this two Michelin star restaurant in Milan, the walls are covered with bold abstract artwork and the service is impeccable.</li>
            <li><a href="https://giacomomilano.com/en/"><strong>Giacomo.</strong></a> High fashion and local business meet in this understated yet stylish establishment found on an anonymous residential street just 15 minutes from the historical city center. Speak to any local about where to dine and they will often tell you Giacomo is one of the best restaurants in Milan.

              While you might be dining alongside Milan’s elegant locals, don’t be surprised if you see Giorgio Armani or Orlando Bloom enjoying the cuisine too. If you’re not looking out for celebrities, the decor is something to be marveled at: celadon-colored walls, bookshelves and a striking mosaic floor provide exquisite surroundings. The cuisine includes fresh seafood prepared with wonderful Italian simplicity, sophisticated pasta dishes and delectable desserts.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ristorantecracco.it/en/"><strong>Cracco.</strong></a> One of the most awarded restaurants in Milan, Cracco has received a prestigious Michelin star and has been listed in San Pellegrino’s 100 best restaurants. As a result, many people consider this to be one of Milan’s best restaurants. However, Cracco is not only a restaurant – within the space there is also a bar, a bistro, a wine cellar and a pastry shop. All are worth a visit.

              At the restaurant, Chef Carlo Cracco is actively updating Milanese cuisine. Sample some of the more unusual dishes such as fish soup crust and yolk marinated with asparagus and black truffle, or opt for more traditional pasta dishes including risotto. No matter your choice, expect your dishes to be well accompanied with the finest wines, hand picked by the restaurant’s award-winning sommelier.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.fourseasons.com/milan/dining/restaurants/zelo/"><strong>Zelo at The Four Seasons</strong></a> overlooks the hotel’s beautiful gardens, which act as a fabulous backdrop to this gourmet restaurant. Flooded with natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows, Zelo serves lighter meals during the day and more gourmet options for dinner; its location makes it one of the most romantic spots in the city.

              Although a destination restaurant, it is still popular with locals, who come to enjoy a menu that incorporates true Italian and Mediterranean cuisine. All the dishes are created using local and seasonal produce. Expect dishes like Milanese-style sweetbread with saffron rice cream and Traditional Prestige Caviar.
              
              The restaurant also has its own pastry chef: Daniele Bonzi is the genius behind the hotel’s one-of-a-kind Chocolate Room. Among his many desserts, Bonzi makes sorbets, fresh-fruit tartlets and a Milano-style tiramisu.</li>
            <li><a href="https://sadler.it/"><strong>Sadler.</strong></a> Having dedicated his creativity to Italian cuisine, it’s understandable why Claudio Sadler’s eponymous restaurant, Sadler, is widely considered one of the best places to eat in Milan.

              Reinventing traditional dishes in bold ways using primary ingredients has earned the restaurant a Michelin star and a listing in Le Sorte, an association that only includes restaurants dedicated to true Italian cuisine. There are several menus at Sadler, ranging from an a la carte selection to tasting menus named ‘Emotion’ and ‘Tradition & Innovation’. The main restaurant is garnished throughout with modern art; there is also a private dining room and a “niche” dining space perfect for intimate, romantic evenings.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.contrastemilano.it/en/"><strong>Contraste.</strong></a> Slightly different from the other restaurants on our list, Contraste is a fun, surprising and fully immersive culinary experience based on the chef’s respect for traditional flavors, fresh ingredients reinterpreting forms and aspects.

              Using innovative shapes, plating and experimentation, the food invites guests to involve all their senses during their experience at the restaurant. When guests arrive, they are seated at tables with white table cloths in a relatively blank space; it is only after the experience begins that everything from the cutlery to the food starts to arrive. The menu is similarly mysterious, with nine dishes that change and feature seasonal ingredients, making Contraste one of the most desirable places to eat in Milan.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.noburestaurants.com/milan/home/"><strong>Nobu Milan</strong></a> is a marriage from heaven combining high Italian fashion of Armani with world-renowned sushi.

              On the ground floor, in the casual lounge bar, sip cocktails accompanied by a selection of sushi. For a new sophisticated experience book a table on the first floor and order from a sumptuous menu designed by Nobuyuki Matsuhisa.</li>
